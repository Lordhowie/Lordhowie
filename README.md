- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Lordhowie

I am a self-taught developer. I started out with a problem within my business which I tried to outsource to one of the popular freelance sites. 
When I had paid 3 people and still not got the result I wanted I decide to teach myself. I started out with Python and have progressed since then into a number of different
areas. My main focus now is creating Blockchain apps and Smart Contracts to help shape the future.


- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently interested in automation projects and creating more efficient systems with the help of code.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Solidity and Haskell and also researching different uses of blockchain technologyto see how the market will develop and hope to be a part of that
      development.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me? contact me on howardgray65@gmail.com or send me a message.
